DATA EXPLORATION ON COVID 19 DATASET

I conducted a data exploration analysis on a COVID-19 dataset to understand the impact of the pandemic on global population. The dataset comprised global COVID-19 data, including daily reported cases, deaths, testing rates & vaccination rates. The objectives of the project were to analyze the spread of COVID-19 across the globe, identify regions with the highest infection rates and mortality rates & explore the vaccination process. Using SQL, I extracted relevant data from the COVID-19 dataset, I employed JOINs, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Converting Data Types etc.
